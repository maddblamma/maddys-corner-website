    <h1>BLOG!</h1>
    <h2>March 15, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      I've been on and off working on this site for a little more than a week, maybe close to two,
      and I'm starting to see what I want finally come to fruition even if it's still got a WAYS to go.
      Hell, I don't even have a navigation thing built yet for these blog posts. I'll get to it when I
      go to make a second one LOL.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said though, I'm honestly proud of myself for sticking with this.
      Whenever this site is in a state that I feel comfortable with, I'll probably start
      up work on my creative endeavours again because having a place
      all to my own to host my stuff on is a serious motivator. I heavily dislike how cookie cutter everything
      is around the internet these days and having a place that feels all my own again is probably the
      biggest motivator I could have possible been given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, I hope whoever's reading this has a
      good rest of their night because it's 12:25 AM as of typing this update. Cya!
