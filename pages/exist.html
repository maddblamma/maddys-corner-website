    <h1>EXIST!</h1>
    <p class="pageText">
      Exist is a far more recent idea that I had, and a far more experimental one at that. 
      I've always wanted to make something a bit abstract and open to potential specific 
      interpretations because Yume Nikki has always been one of my favorite video games and 
      a good chunk of what makes it fun to me and a lot of other people is the fact that it's 
      as open to interpretation as it is.

      It's half vent art and half just me and my fiance JovialEclipse coming up with what we think 
      is neat imagery. Though if you're sensitive to unsettling/upsetting imagery I do recommend 
      looking at the content warning at the bottom of the page because it's gonna be pretty visceral.

      Oh, and did I mention that it started life as a crappy youtube short that I published to my channel? 
      People seemed to like it enough when I made it a while back, but I'm personally not proud of it
      because I rushed it and the actual meaning was lost in translation due to how quickly I rushed it 
      out just to say that I made something. I'll probably rework this into the comic somehow and hopefully 
      convey what I was trying to get across.
