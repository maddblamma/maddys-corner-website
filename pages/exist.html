      <h1>EXIST!</h1>
      <p>
        Exist is a far more recent idea that I had, and a far more experimental one at that. 
        I've always wanted to make something a bit abstract and open to potential specific 
        interpretations because Yume Nikki has always been one of my favorite video games and 
        a good chunk of what makes it fun to me and a lot of other people is the fact that it's 
        as open to interpretation as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's half vent art and half just me and my fiance JovialEclipse coming up with what we think 
        is neat imagery. I'm not going to confirm or deny what each comic strip will actually mean because 
        I think the imagery speaks for itself, plus that defeats the point of leaving it open to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though if you're sensitive to unsettling/upsetting imagery I do recommend looking at the content warning 
        at the bottom of the page because it's gonna be pretty visceral. If not though, don't scroll too far 
        down. I spaced it out JUST enough to allow for people to go in at least a twinge blind if they'd wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and did I mention that it started life as a crappy youtube short that I published to my channel? 
        People seemed to like it enough when I made it a while back, but I'm personally not proud of it
        because I rushed it and the actual meaning was lost in translation due to how quickly I rushed it 
        out just to say that I made something. I'll probably rework this into the comic somehow and hopefully 
        convey what I was trying to get across.

      <h2>Content Warnings</h2>
      <p>
        Instances of extreme gore, unsettling imagery, and 
        elements of horror. A singular depiction of dysphoria.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know what I said about leaving stuff open to interpetation but I owe it to my trans fellas and 
        ladies to not subject them to an admittedly visceral depiction of dysphoria if they don't want 
        to see it.
